# Abnormal Bot
Informational/moderational bot created for EQD's Discord. Made by me, using `discord.py` by Rapptz.

You need [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and *probably* [python itself](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this.
Follow all the steps for installing `discord.py` carefully. Also [Derpibooru python lib](https://github.com/joshua-stone/DerPyBooru) by joshua-stone.

To run the bot, you can probably just double click it or run via `cmd`, but there is a chance that you might need to start it by manually putting it into command line for python.

To stop it, issue a stop command by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the cmd window.

## What we have now:
- User join
- User leave
- Roles change
- Name change
- Nickname change
- Avatar change

- Message deletion
- Message edit
- Message pins
- Image caching (discord's native)

- Ban logging
- Ban reason
- Userinfo command
- Serverinfo command

- Derpibooru integration
- EQD integration
- Reaction to mentions

And only in console:
- Use of banned words
- Oversized images
- Discord invites

## What we still need:
- Audit log use
- Image caching (saving on server?)
- Past names command
- Stream notifications
- Music stuff
